** Create a patch & submit

* Building Firefox
** Make a change and re-build to see effects
** Watching some of the codefirefox.com videos on directory structure

* Lots of dev env set up done, understanding of how each problem will have certain setup requirements in order to have a feedback loop, test changes, submit patch(es)
