My week two
=====
----Tuesday

         This  week is going much smoother. I'm feeling much better and more capable. Things are making sense. I feel my mind is opening up and excepting the information we are receiving. I'm feeling very content.

----Wednesday

         Today was a fun day we looked for bugs. I really enjoyed learning this. It was also nice to get out for lunch. It was refreshing. My partner today was good to work with.  I learned alot from here it was nice.
