### Test your bug

Is it a bug?  Here are some questions to ask yourself:
* Can I reproduce it?
	- every time OR intermittently
		- if intermittently, can you state about how often?
* Open a Clean Profile in the same version of Firefox that you found the bug.  
(if you haven't set up profiles, go [here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles))

* Open a Clean Profile in another version of Firefox.
	- for example, if you are reproducing this bug in Firefox Nightly, try and see if you find the same bug in a new Firefox Aurora profile.  (This is called "Regression") (if you haven't set up to run different version of Firefox at the same time, go [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Multiple_Firefox_Profiles) first and scroll down to the last three paragraphs titled "Setting up multiple profiles for different Firefox Channels")

### File your bug

After you have completed these tests, head on over to [Bugzilla@Mozilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/).  You'll need to create an account in Bugzilla and later, can sign in using your [Persona Account](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-is-persona-and-how-does-it-work).

* Click on "File a Bug"

* Scroll down the list and find the service that you want to report a bug on (ie if you were using Nightly, then click on "Firefox" which is first on the list)

* Type short summary of the issue in the white box just before hitting "find similar issues.”  You'll want to see if someone else has already filed this bug.

* If you don’t see your issue listed, continue on by clicking on the button "My issue is not listed (see the above/previous screen shot)."
* Fill in report
  * Your summary will already be entered from the previous screen.
  * Check to make sure the Product category is still correct.
  * Fill in the whitebox for "What did you do."  
    * Try to clearly state the steps that you took to reproduce the bug.  Use
concise, descriptive language as you are guiding someone else on how to follow what you did.
  * Fill in the whitebox for "What happened?"  
    * Again, be clear on explaining what the actual results you attained.
  * Fill in the next whitebox for "What should have happened?."
